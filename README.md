# Campus Tutoring Platform

This project was developed during the CRAI Hackathon 2025 at Federal University Dutse. The Campus Tutoring Platform connects students in need of academic help with fellow students who can offer tutoring services across different subjects and fields.

## Problem Statement
Many students struggle to find academic help within their campus. There’s no structured system to connect learners with those willing to teach. This platform solves that by making it easy to find, book, and attend tutoring sessions — with options for gender preference, free and paid plans, and verified tutors.

## Features
- Student and Tutor registration and login
- Profile customization
- Tutor search and filter by subject, gender, and availability
- Booking system for sessions
- Free and VIP (paid) tutoring sessions
- Admin dashboard for managing users and sessions

## Tech Stack Used
**Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB  
**Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)  
**Version Control**: Git & GitHub
